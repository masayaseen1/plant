    Fruits are <b>nature's candy</b>, bursting with <em>vibrant colors</em>, <u>sweet flavors</u>, and <b>essential vitamins</b>. From the <b>juicy explosions</b> of watermelons to the <em>tart pops</em> of berries, they offer a <b>delightful</b> and <u>healthy way</u> to satisfy your <b>sweet tooth</b>. But beyond their taste, fruits play a vital role in our diet, providing us with <b>fiber</b>, <em>antioxidants</em>, and other <u>nutrients</u> to keep our bodies functioning at their best.

    <h3>Planting and Care</h3>
    <blockquote>Proper planting and care are essential for growing healthy fruit plants.</blockquote>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><span class="bold">Soil preparation:</span> Ensure your soil is well-draining and amended with organic matter like compost or manure. Test your soil's pH and adjust it if necessary for your chosen fruits.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Planting:</span> Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the root ball of your plant. Gently loosen the roots and place the plant in the hole, ensuring the root crown sits slightly above the soil level. Backfill the hole and water thoroughly.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Watering:</span> Water your fruit plants regularly, especially during the first year after planting. The frequency will depend on your climate, soil type, and rainfall patterns. Aim to keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Fertilizing:</span> Feed your fruit plants with a balanced fertilizer formulated for fruit trees or bushes. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package for proper application rates and frequency.</li>
