  <h3>Planting and Care</h3>
<blockquote>Proper planting and care are essential for growing healthy hanging plants.</blockquote>
<ol class="list">
    <li><span class="bold">Soil Preparation:</span> Ensure your soil is well-draining and amended with organic matter like compost or peat moss. Hanging plants require soil that retains moisture without becoming waterlogged.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Potting:</span> Select a hanging basket or pot with drainage holes. Use a lightweight, well-draining potting mix specifically formulated for indoor or outdoor hanging plants. Place the plant in the container, ensuring the root ball is positioned securely.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Watering:</span> Water your hanging plants regularly, but allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Adjust watering frequency based on factors like humidity, sunlight exposure, and plant size.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Fertilizing:</span> Feed your hanging plants with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season. Dilute the fertilizer according to package instructions and apply it every few weeks to promote healthy growth and vibrant foliage.</li>
